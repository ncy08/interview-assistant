# Security Implementation Status

## Current Security Features

### ✅ API Call Tracking
- Implementation: Complete
- Location: `app/transcribe/db/app_invocations.py`
- Features:
  - SQLite database tracking
  - Start/end time monitoring
  - Invocation logging
  - Session management

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting
- Implementation: Partial
- Location: `tsutils/utilities.py`
- Current Features:
  - Basic API validation
  - Connection testing
- Missing Features:
  - Request throttling
  - Rate limit configuration
  - Monitoring and alerts
  - Per-endpoint limits

### ❌ Keyring Integration
- Implementation: Not Started
- Current State:
  - Using YAML files for key storage
  - No secure key management
  - No key rotation
- Required Features:
  - Secure keyring integration
  - Key rotation support
  - Migration from YAML
  - Backup procedures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Keyring Integration
1. Add keyring dependencies
2. Implement secure key storage
3. Create migration utility
4. Update configuration handling
5. Add key rotation support

### Phase 2: Rate Limiting Enhancement
1. Add rate limit configuration
2. Implement request throttling
3. Add rate limit tracking
4. Create monitoring system
5. Add alert mechanisms

## Security Best Practices
- All API keys must be stored in the system keyring
- Rate limits should be enforced for all API endpoints
- All API calls must be logged and monitored
- Regular key rotation should be implemented
- Secure configuration management must be used

## Notes
- Security implementations are part of Task 1.3
- Currently tracking issues in GitHub repository
